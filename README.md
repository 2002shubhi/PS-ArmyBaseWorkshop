## Visual Detection of Drones by Integration of Fog time Images with AI <br />
As drone attracts much interest, the drone industry has opened their
market to ordinary people, making drones to be used in daily lives. 
However, as it got easier for drone to be used by more people, safety 
and security issues have raised as accidents are much more likely to 
happen colliding into people by losing control or invading secured 
properties. For safety purposes, it is essential for observers and drone to 
be aware of an approaching drone. Our project is a step in this very same 
direction. The Indian Army should be aware of hostile drones 
approaching in regions which have low or reduced visibility during. Fog 
Time, Day Time, and Thermal AI Detection combined will provide well 
rounded drone detection system to the Indian Army.

# Learning Outcomes
1) Since we were unable to get a dataset of fog time drone images, we used a normal day time dataset of drone images and used the albumentations library to simulate fog on the images virtually.
2) Once we had the fog time data set, we trained our AI program using YOLOv4 library which detects the objects through a bounding box. A bounding box is any imaginary rectangle that serves as a point of reference for object detection and creates a collision box for that object.
3) Users can put any link of an image from the internet in the inference .ipynb file and the program will display the results accordingly.

# Future Scope and Work Plans
1) Model Compression and increasing inference speed for on device deployment. If we want to have real world usage of this program, we will have to reduce its size so that we can get the program up and running on drones.

2) Testing of the product will be done, and the bugs or glitches if found will be fixed. We will also create a readme file for the program and then final product, along with the entire source code will be submitted to our PS instructor.
